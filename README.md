# Lychees-Quality-Classification-with-YOLOv10
This project aims to classify the quality of lychees using the YOLOv10 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The provided Jupyter notebook demonstrates the steps for training and evaluating the model to distinguish between different quality categories of lychees.
## Introduction
Lychees are a popular fruit, and their quality classification is crucial for consumer satisfaction and market value. This project uses YOLOv10, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to classify lychee quality into predefined categories.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of lychees categorized into different quality classes. Each image contains annotations specifying the quality label.
##Installation
To run the notebook and train the model, you'll need to set up your environment with the required dependencies.
